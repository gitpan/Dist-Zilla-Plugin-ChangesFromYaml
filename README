SYNOPSIS
    In your 'dist.ini':

        [ChangesFromYaml]

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you keep your Changes file in YAML format:

        version: 0.37
        date:    Fri Oct 25 21:46:59 MYT 2013
        changes:
        - 'Bugfix: Run Test::Compile tests as xt as they require optional dependencies to be present (GH issue #22)'
        - 'Testing: Added Travis-CI integration'
        - 'Makefile: Added target to update version on all packages'

    and during build converts it to CPAN::Changes::Spec format

        0.37 Fri Oct 25 21:46:59 MYT 2013
         - Bugfix: Run Test::Compile tests as xt as they require optional
           dependencies to be present (GH issue #22)
         - Testing: Added Travis-CI integration
         - Makefile: Added target to update version on all packages

DATE FORMAT
    The dates used on the YAML format can also be converted if they don't
    follow CPAN::Changes::Spec rules.

    Ie. if you keep your dates as the output of `date` (Sun Oct 27 02:10:50
    MYT 2013), add:

        [ChangesFromYaml]
        dateformat = ccc MMM dd HH:mm:ss zzz yyyy

    This will convert your dates from:

        version: 0.37
        date:    Fri Oct 25 21:46:59 MYT 2013

    into:

        0.37 2013-10-25 21:46:59 +0800

    For documentation on the pattern, read DateTime::Format::CLDR.
